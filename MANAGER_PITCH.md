# UniHostel - Pitch Script for Hostel Managers

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Good [morning/afternoon], [Manager's Name]. I'm [Your Name] from UniHostel. I know you're busy managing your hostel, so I'll be quick. 

**What if I told you that you could fill your empty rooms faster, get paid instantly, and spend less time on paperwork—all without changing how you run your hostel?**

That's exactly what UniHostel does for hostel managers like you."

---

## The Problem (1 minute)

"Let me ask you a few questions:

1. **How many hours do you spend each week answering calls and messages from students looking for rooms?**
2. **How often do students promise to pay but never show up?**
3. **Do you ever have empty rooms because students don't know your hostel exists?**
4. **How much time do you waste chasing students for payments?**

I've talked to dozens of hostel managers, and they all say the same thing: **'I spend more time finding tenants than actually managing my property.'**

Sound familiar?"

---

## The Solution (1 minute)

"UniHostel solves all of this. Here's how:

### 1. **Students Find YOU**
- Your hostel is listed on our platform where thousands of students are actively searching
- No more waiting for phone calls—students come to you

### 2. **Get Paid BEFORE They Move In**
- Students pay online through mobile money or card
- Money hits your account instantly—no chasing, no excuses
- Only serious students who've already paid apply to you

### 3. **You Stay in Control**
- You approve or reject applications
- You set your prices
- You decide who gets the room
- We just bring the customers and handle the money

### 4. **Zero Upfront Cost**
- Free to list your hostel
- We only take a small 3% platform fee when you get paid
- If you don't make money, we don't make money"

## The Numbers (30 seconds)

"Let me show you what this means in real money:

**Without UniHostel:**
- Empty room for 2 weeks = **GH₵0**
- Student promises to pay but disappears = **GH₵0**
- Time wasted on calls and messages = **Priceless**

**With UniHostel:**
- Room filled in 3 days = **GH₵1,000**
- Student already paid = **GH₵1,000 in your account**
- Time spent = **5 minutes to approve application**

**You keep GH₵1,000. We take GH₵30. You save 10+ hours of work.**

Which would you prefer?"

## Handle Objections

### "I don't trust online payments"
"I understand. But here's the thing—**you get paid directly by Paystack, Ghana's most trusted payment company.** The same company MTN, Vodafone, and major banks use. Your money goes straight to your mobile money or bank account. We never touch it."

### "I'm not good with technology"
"You don't need to be. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use UniHostel. It's literally:
1. Click 'Approve' or 'Reject'
2. That's it.

I'll set up everything for you in 10 minutes. You just need your phone number for mobile money."

### "Students already know my hostel"
"That's great! But ask yourself:
- How many students DON'T know about you?
- How many go to your competitor because they found them online first?
- What happens when your current students graduate?

UniHostel puts you in front of **every student searching for accommodation**—not just the ones who already know you."

### "What if students complain or cause problems?"
"You're still 100% in control. You:
- Screen every application
- Approve only students you want
- Set your own rules
- Handle the room just like you do now

We just handle the marketing and payments. Everything else stays the same."

### "I can't afford the fees"
"You don't pay anything upfront. Zero. 

We only take 3% when a student pays you. So if you charge GH₵1,000, you get GH₵970 instantly. 

Compare that to:
- Empty rooms = GH₵0
- Students who don't pay = GH₵0
- Advertising costs = GH₵50-200

With us, you only pay when you make money. It's the safest deal you'll ever get."

## The Close (1 minute)

"Look, [Manager's Name], I'm not asking you to change everything you do. I'm just offering you a tool to:

✅ Fill your rooms faster  
✅ Get paid instantly  
✅ Reach more students  
✅ Spend less time on admin work  

**Here's what I'm proposing:**

Let me list your hostel on UniHostel today—**completely free**. If you get applications, great. If you don't, you've lost nothing. But if you do, you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner.

**All I need from you is:**
1. Your hostel details (name, location, price)
2. Your mobile money number for payments
3. 10 minutes of your time

Can we do that right now?"

---

## Bonus: Social Proof

"By the way, [mention any other managers who've joined, or say]:

- We already have [X] hostels on the platform
- Students are searching for rooms every single day
- The managers who joined early are already getting applications

**The question is: Do you want to be the hostel students find first, or the one they never hear about?**"

---

## Follow-Up (If They Say "Let Me Think About It")

"I totally understand. But let me ask you this:

**How much money are you losing every day your rooms stay empty?**

If it's GH₵50/day, that's GH₵1,500/month. 

Listing on UniHostel takes 10 minutes and costs nothing. Even if you get just ONE booking, you've made your money back.

**What's there to think about?**

Tell you what—I'll set up your listing right now while we talk. If you don't like it, I'll take it down. Fair?"

---

## Emergency Close (If They're Still Hesitant)

"[Manager's Name], I respect your decision. But before I go, let me leave you with this:

**In 6 months, every hostel around here will be online. Students will book rooms from their phones without ever visiting in person. That's where the world is going.**

You can either be ahead of the curve and get the early students, or you can wait and compete with everyone else later.

**I'm offering you a head start. For free. Right now.**

What do you say?"
