## 🔍 Verify It's Working:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting:

### Emails Not Sending?

**Problem:** "Email not configured" in logs
**Solution:** Set EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env and restart

**Problem:** "Invalid credentials"
**Solution:** Use App Password, not regular Gmail password

**Problem:** Emails go to spam
**Solution:** 
- Ask users to whitelist 1mikedwin@gmail.com
- For production, use AWS SES or SendGrid

---

## 📊 Email Limits:

### Gmail (Current):
- **Free:** Yes
- **Limit:** 500 emails/day
- **Good for:** Testing & small scale

### AWS SES (Recommended for Production):
- **Free:** 62,000 emails/month
- **Cost:** $0.10 per 1,000 emails after
- **Better:** Deliverability & reputation

## 🎯 What Happens Without Email Setup:

✅ App works normally
✅ Notifications logged to console
✅ Users can still use platform
❌ No email notifications sent

**Bottom line:** Email is optional but highly recommended for better UX!
