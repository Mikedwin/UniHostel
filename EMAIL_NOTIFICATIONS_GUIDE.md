## Testing Checklist:

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Set EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env
- [ ] Restart backend server
- [ ] Check logs for email configuration status

### Test Scenarios:
1. [ ] Register new student account
2. [ ] Submit application → Check both student & manager emails
3. [ ] Manager approves → Check student email
4. [ ] Complete payment → Check student email
5. [ ] Manager final approval → Check student email with access code
6. [ ] Manager rejects application → Check student email

## Email Not Sending?

### Troubleshooting:
1. **Check .env file:**
   - EMAIL_USER is correct
   - EMAIL_PASSWORD is app password (not regular password)
   
2. **Check Gmail settings:**
   - 2FA enabled
   - App password generated
   - "Less secure app access" NOT needed (we use app passwords)

3. **Check logs:**
   - Backend console shows email attempts
   - Winston logs in `backend/logs/` folder

4. **Fallback behavior:**
   - If email fails, app continues working
   - Notifications logged to console
   - Users can still use platform

## Production Considerations:

### Current Setup (Gmail):
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Easy to setup
- ⚠️ Daily limit: 500 emails
- ⚠️ May be flagged as spam

### Recommended for Scale:
- **AWS SES** (Simple Email Service)
  - 62,000 free emails/month
  - Better deliverability
  - Professional sender reputation
  
- **SendGrid**
  - 100 emails/day free
  - Email analytics
  - Template management

- **Mailgun**
  - 5,000 emails/month free
  - API-based
  - Good for transactional emails

## Security Notes:
- ✅ App passwords used (not main password)
- ✅ Credentials in .env (not committed to git)
- ✅ Email failures don't crash app
- ✅ No sensitive data in email logs
- ✅ Access codes only sent after payment

## User Experience Impact:
- ✅ Students know application status immediately
- ✅ Managers alerted to new applications
- ✅ Payment confirmations build trust
- ✅ Access codes delivered securely
- ✅ Professional communication

## Next Steps:
1. Configure EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env
2. Test all email flows
3. Monitor email delivery
4. Consider upgrading to AWS SES for production
5. Add email preferences (opt-in/opt-out)
