- Use clear, well-lit photos of your hostel
- Landscape orientation works best

### Pricing
- When you change room prices, pending applications are automatically updated
- Already paid applications keep their original price

### Capacity
- Current occupancy is shown (e.g., "5/20 Occupied")
- You can increase capacity but not below current occupancy
- System prevents overbooking automatically

### Facilities
- Select all facilities that apply to each room type
- More facilities = more attractive to students
- Be honest about what's available
