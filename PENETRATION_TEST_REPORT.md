**Finding:** No sensitive data (passwords, secrets, tokens) exposed in API responses  
**Result:** All sensitive fields properly excluded from responses.

#### 9. Input Sanitization ✅
**Status:** SECURE  
**Finding:** Comprehensive input validation middleware active  
**Validations:**
- Email: Regex pattern matching

**Result:** 403 Forbidden responses returned correctly.

---

### ⚠️ WARNINGS (2/12)

#### 11. Rate Limiting ⚠️
**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION  
**Current Configuration:**
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Auth endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

**Issue:** Rate limiting may not be aggressive enough for production.  
**Recommendation:** Consider reducing to:
- General API: 60 requests per 15 minutes
- Auth endpoints: 3 attempts per 15 minutes
- Add IP-based blocking after repeated violations

**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### 12. Security Headers (Helmet.js) ⚠️
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Present Headers:**
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

**Missing/Weak Headers:**
- ⚠️ X-Content-Type-Options: May not be visible in Vercel deployment
- ⚠️ X-Frame-Options: May not be visible in Vercel deployment
- ⚠️ X-XSS-Protection: Deprecated but still useful for older browsers

**Note:** These headers may be present in the backend but not visible when testing through Vercel's CDN.

**Recommendation:** Verify headers are properly set in backend deployment.

**Priority:** LOW
